Good start on this - 85% - but, I think that you can go a bit deeper for each answer.  I'm really looking to see that you understand how flow occurs, what affects it.  Your answers are not wrong - although the first and last are incomplete - but, they are a bit superficial.  Convince me that you are getting a feel for flow systems!
